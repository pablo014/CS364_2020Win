    <h2>Overview of the Technique</h2>
    <p>Brainstorming is a technique that allows individuals and groups to come up with new innovative ideas towards solving a problem. [1] There are various methods for creating effective brainstorming; however, brainstorming works best when all participants of the group are attentive and open to new ideas. When participants are open to suggestions, people within the group are more open to sharing their thoughts. This group process of sharing ideas openly allows for the best ideas to emerge. </p>
    <p>An advantage to brainstorming is the large amount of ideas that are generated. [2, 3] The disadvantages are that this technique is not meant to resolve major issues or conflicts. It is meant for just the generation of ideas and not the deep diving of ideas. Thus, why ideas may seem great to begin with may end up being difficult to implement due to team inexperience.</p>
    <p>Brainstorming was created in 1939 by a man named Alex F. Osborn, in an article states that “He suggests a group of 5-10 people to sit together for about an hour. The problem to be solved must be outlined clearly ("single target") and the group needs one person to lead the session.”[1] The lead’s main role is to be a facilitator and assure that creativity thrives. Participants are free to share opinions without criticism, and everything will be written down. [4]</p>
    <p>The details on how Osborn would direct a brainstorm session are quite important for a successful brainstorming session. Gathering a group of 5-10 people allows for a variety of perspectives on a certain topic or problem. Gregerson states that “bringing others into the process will give you access to a wider knowledge base and help you maintain a constructive mindset.”[5] And it is true, allowing people into your brainstorming sessions allows for many ideas to emerge even ideas that you wouldn’t think of.</p>
    <p>Gregerson expands on this idea by proposing that “It's best to include two or three people who have no direct experience with the problem and whose cognitive style or worldview is starkly different from yours.”[5] This idea allows for ideas different from ideas that are your own to thrive, and it makes it easier for the group to think outside of the box.</p>
    <p>The next thing Osborn details is the need for the problem to be “outlined clearly.” Having a well-defined problem solves a lot of problems that groups, and individuals have in most brainstorming sessions. Without a defined problem, the conversation becomes random and a solution is never achieved, due to lack of direction. However, if groups have a focal point discuss, conversation revolves around that topic, solutions are generated, and progress is made within the group. [5]</p>
    <p>Brainstorming helps groups come up with ideas that go beyond an individual’s scope. By allowing groups to think to solve a singular problem, a large amount of ideas are generated and can be utilized to benefit everyone.</p>
    <h2>Technique Plan</h2>
    <h3>List of Steps</h3>
    <p>1. Do preliminary research of similar applications, to base brainstorming off successful apps.</p>
    <p>2. Meet with stakeholder to go over ideas. Ask if he has any ideas for possible features, interfaces, designs, colors, mechanics, and functionality for the app and where he sees the app going.</p>
    <p>3. During the meeting, detailed notes will be taken to be used for the report as well as for the remainder of the project.</p>
    <p>4. The notes will be used to determine what should be added to the application and what shouldn’t.</p>
    <p>The meeting with the stakeholder will take place Thursday April 30th at 2:00 pm. The research will be due before that meeting. The notes from the meeting will be used to finish the report, and that report will be finished by the 5pm on May 2nd.</p>
    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>App will have:</p>
    <p>1. Business accounts and user accounts </p>
    <p>2. Will be similar to Facebook or Tinder </p>
    <p>3. GPS notifications for nearby people and activities</p>
    <p>4. Filtering ability</p>
    <h2>Correllated Data</h2>
    <p>The data could organize everything into three main categories. The design of the application, how the accounts of this application will work, and the features of the application.</p>
    <h3>Design Section: </h3>
    <p>For the design section the sponsor did not want any of the colors like Tinder, Facebook or any other common application. The logo should be at the top of the screen and the promotions and events should just be right under the logo. There should be some basic information on the events that are created and hosted such as description, attendees, pricing and a way for users to join those events they are interested in.</p>
    <h3>Accounts Section</h3>
    <p>The accounts category is more complex. With this application, there will be two different types of users, normal users and business accounts. In a normal user account, they can choose to log in through Facebook or Google. If they don’t want to use those methods, they could just create a new account just for this application. After, they will be asked if they want to import their friends contacts so they might invite them to join the application or just other events. There will be two types of accounts for normal users. Normal users can join events but only the premium users can create events and get credits and or discounts to businesses around them. </p>
    <p>Business accounts are for companies that want to use and leverage this application to increase profits for their business. They will have opportunities to bid for top spots for advertisements within the application. They will also have a chance to offer discounts for users to increase business. One key feature is that businesses can report users if they book an event but don’t show without first canceling.</p>
    <h3>Features Section:</h3>
    <p>There are 4 parts for the features. The sponsor wanted to have a button that will choose a random event for the user to go to if they don’t know which event they wanted to attend. While scrolling or swiping throw all the events it would be nice to have a filtering feature that could separate different days, times, group sizes, distance from users, and even the prices. This feature would give the users a better way to find events that fit their budgets and needs. Notifications are another feature that would be needed to get a user’s attention when a new event is near them or if another user has messaged them. The last feature that was discussed was GPS tracking. This would help users see nearby events and people that are near them so they can meet up and get to know each other. </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Brainstorming is an effective Elicitation Requirement Technique. Brainstorming gathers large amounts of potentially useful ideas, and it allows for the participants to contribute their perspectives towards solving the problem.  The brainstorming plan was executed successfully. The stakeholder provided useful and understandable data about what he envisions for the app and potential additions to the app. The data gained will be able to contribute to the writing of the SRS and SDD. </p>
